## Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/chat-application.git
Open the project in your favorite Java IDE (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse).

Compile and run the Server class for the server side first and then the Client class for the client side.

Usage
Start the server by running the Server class. The server will listen for incoming connections on port 7777.

Start one or more clients by running the Client class. Provide the server's IP address and port number (default is 7777) 
ex:socket=new Socket("IP_Address(or localhost)", portNo integer ); replace this line of code in the client side .

Begin chatting between the server and client(s). Type messages and press Enter to send them.

To exit, type "exit" and press Enter. This will close the connection.
